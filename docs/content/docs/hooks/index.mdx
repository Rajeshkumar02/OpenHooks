# 🎣 React Hooks & `open-hook`

## 🧠 What are Hooks in React?

**React Hooks** are built-in functions that let you use state and other React features without writing a class. They make components simpler, more readable, and reusable.

Some common built-in hooks include:

- `useState` — for managing local state
- `useEffect` — for side effects like data fetching
- `useRef`, `useMemo`, `useCallback`, and more

Custom hooks let you extract reusable logic into shared utilities — that’s where this project comes in!

---

## 🚀 What is `open-hook`?

**`open-hook`** is a developer-friendly CLI tool that helps you:

- 📦 Install community-contributed reusable React custom hooks
- 📃 View available hooks with descriptions and support info
- ⚙️ Initialize project-level configuration
- 🛠️ Choose JavaScript or TypeScript output
- 🔄 Avoid rewriting the same logic again and again!

Hooks are fetched directly from a centralized GitHub repo and installed locally into your project’s `hooks` folder.

## 🔧 Quick Start

Get up and running with **open-hook** in just a few steps! This CLI tool helps you fetch and manage reusable React hooks from a centralized repository.

---

### 🛠 Step 1: Initialize Your Project Configuration

```bash
open-hook init
```

This command creates a config file (`open-hooks.config.json`) in your project root. You'll be prompted to set:

- 📁 **Hook Directory** – Where downloaded hooks will be saved (e.g., `src/hooks`)
- 🧠 **Default Language** – Choose between `TypeScript` or `JavaScript`
- 🌐 **Repository URL** – The GitHub repo from which to fetch hooks (default provided)

---

### 📥 Step 2: Add Hooks to Your Project

```bash
open-hook add
```

This command lets you:

- 🔍 Interactively **browse all available hooks**
- ⌨️ Or install hooks directly by name:
  ```bash
  open-hook add Debounce Clipboard --language ts
  ```

If a hook already exists in your project, you'll get smart options:

- Replace the existing file
- Skip it
- Cancel the entire process

---

### 📃 Step 3: List All Available Hooks

```bash
open-hook list
```

Displays a clean, tabular list of all hooks available in the repository along with:

- ✅ Language availability (JS/TS)
- 📝 Short description
- 📦 Hook names

---

✨ That’s it! You’re now ready to supercharge your React workflow with reusable, battle-tested hooks.
