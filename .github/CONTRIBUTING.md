## ðŸ§¾ Guidelines

- All changes must go through a **pull request** (PR)
- PRs must be reviewed and approved before being merged
- PRs that affect CLI behavior or hooks must be tested
- PR titles should follow this format: `feat:`, `fix:`, `docs:`, `chore:`, etc.

## ðŸ“‚ Adding a New Hook

1. Add your hook to the correct directory:
   - `hooks/js/useSomething.js` or `hooks/ts/useSomething.ts`

2. Update `hooks/manifest.json`:

```json
{
  "name": "useSomething",
  "description": "Brief description here",
  "js": true,
  "ts": true
}
```

3. Run `pnpm start` or `pnpm build` and test with CLI:
```bash
pnpm open-hooks-cli add useSomething
```

## ðŸš« What Will Be Rejected
